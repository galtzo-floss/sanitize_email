    # There are three ways SanitizeEmail can be turned on; in order of precedence they are:
    #
    # 1. SanitizeEmail.force_sanitize = true # by default it is nil
    # 2. Mail.register_interceptor(SanitizeEmail::Bleach.new(:engage => true)) # by default it is nil
    # 3. SanitizeEmail::Config.configure {|config| config[:activation_proc] = Proc.new { true } } be default it is false
    #
    # Note: Number 1 is the method used by the SanitizeEmail.sanitary block
    # Note: Number 2 would not be used unless you setup your own register_interceptor)
    # If installed but not configured, sanitize email DOES NOTHING.  Until configured the defaults leave it turned off.
