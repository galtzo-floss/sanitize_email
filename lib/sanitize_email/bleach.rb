    # Will be called by the Hook to determine if an override should occur
    # There are three ways SanitizeEmail can be turned on;
    #   in order of precedence they are:
    #
    # 1. SanitizeEmail.force_sanitize = true # by default it is nil
    #   Only useful for local context.
    #   Inside a method where you will be sending an email, set
    #
    #     SanitizeEmail.force_sanitize = true
    #
    #   just prior to delivering it.  Also useful in the console.
    #
    # 2. If SanitizeEmail seems to not be sanitizing,
    #     you have probably not registered the interceptor.
    #   SanitizeEmail tries to do this for you.
    #   *Note*: If you are working in an environment that has
    #           a Mail or Mailer class that uses the register_interceptor API,
    #           the interceptor will already have been registered.
    #   The gem will probably have already done this for you,
    #   but some really old versions of Rails may need you to do this manually:
    #
    #     Mail.register_interceptor(SanitizeEmail::Bleach)
    #
    #   Once registered, SanitizeEmail needs to be engaged:
    #
    #     # in config/initializers/sanitize_email.rb
    #     SanitizeEmail::Config.configure {|config| config[:engage] = true }
    #
    # 3. SanitizeEmail::Config.configure do |config|
    #      config[:activation_proc] = Proc.new { true }
    #    end
    #
    #   If you don't need to compute anything,
    #     then don't use the Proc, go with the previous option.
    #
    # Note: Number 1 is the method used by the SanitizeEmail.sanitary block
    # Note: Number 2 You may need to setup your own register_interceptor
    #
    # If installed but not configured, sanitize_email DOES NOTHING.
    # Until configured the defaults leave it turned off.
    def self.sanitize_engaged?(message)
      # Don't sanitize the message if it will not be delivered
      return false unless message.perform_deliveries

      # Has it been forced via the force_sanitize mattr?
      forced = SanitizeEmail.force_sanitize
      return forced unless forced.nil?

      # Is this particular instance of Bleach engaged
      engaged = SanitizeEmail::Config.config[:engage]
      return engaged unless engaged.nil?

      # Should we sanitize due to the activation_proc?
      SanitizeEmail.activate?(message)
    end
